T2 fitting of MRI CPMG muscle images

The python notebook contains the function used to fit MRI data to a muscle water/fat model based on the work of Azzabou et al.(1)

The environment.yml file contains the conda environment that was used to run the notebook

A python environment based on this file can be created using the following command once an Anaconda python distribution has been installed

conda py36 create -f environment.yml
